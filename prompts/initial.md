Help me write GEMINI.md for this project.

The project is about reverse engineering a document format of the Corpus application.
Croatian cutting services like Iverpan, Elgrad, Furnir, etc. accept documents from the Corpus application.
These documents contain instructions how to cut panels for furniture as well as information for drilling necessary holes for assembling furniture.

The goal is to create a tool for converting OpenSCAD model to Corpus document with the focus on drilling holes.

Currently it is very easy for an individual to have the panels cut to dimension.

The main difficulty is drilling holes. These services are only willing to do drilling if you provide the drilling specification as a Coprus document.

I have a collection of Corpus documents. Their extension is S3D.

Also there is a detailed user guide documentation in PDF format.

The sample S3D documents are in the @export folder.

The general documentation is in the @Corpus4 and its subfolders.

The web page for the Corpus application is https://corpus.hr/

Make a detailed plan for the project.


After every iteration update @GEMINI.md with the latest findings.

Before each step check the available context and estimate the headroom needed to complete the task. Compress the context if needed.

Update @GEMINI.md
