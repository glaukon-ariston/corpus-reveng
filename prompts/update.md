Make the following actions:
- Use `git status` and `git diff` to get a comprehensive overview of all local changes and better understand their scope.
- Update the @GEMINI.md file with the recent changes and design decisions.
- Update the @artifacts/conversation.md with our recent conversation. Do not delete content from @artifacts/conversation.md, just add to it. 
- Clear the content of the @prompt/commit.md file.
- Prepare the commit message for the recent changes in a raw format, without line numbers and extra indentation. Include detailed findings from `git status` and `git diff` to annotate the commit message for every changed source file. Write it to the @prompt/commit.md file.
